# Introduction

`nuxt-pdf` is a Nuxt 3 wrapper around [html2pdf.js](https://ekoopmans.github.io/html2pdf.js/), a package that allows you to export HTMLElements as a PDF document.

::list{type="success"}
- Adds built in Nuxt 3 support to export components to a PDF Document
- Works with native Nuxt 3 refs, allowing you to keep your clean Nuxt 3 code free from any external package
::

After installing the module you will be able to access the function like so:
```ts
// file: ~/app.vue
import { exportToPDF } from '#imports'

await exportToPDF('my-pdf-file.pdf', HTMLElement)
```
